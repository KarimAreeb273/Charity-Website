    This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for <a href="https://zakat.icclmd.org">https://zakat.icclmd.org</a>. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the following:
    <br />
    <ol>

    <h5><b>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</b></h5>
    We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request (e.g., to record zakat profile information, dependent information, and zakat payments).
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about services and/or changes to this privacy policy.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h5><b>Your Access to and Control Over Information</b></h5>
    You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time by contacting the association and informing us of your decision. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website:
    <br />

    <h5><b>Security</b></h5>
    We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information and personally identifiable information (such as name and date of birth), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only select members of the association who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, approving zakat applications or those performing maintenance and administration) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment with a hosting provider.
