    About Zakat Network
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    Welcome to Zakat Network, a groundbreaking platform dedicated to facilitating the distribution of zakat as well as empowering communities in need. At Zakat Network, we believe in the transformative power of Zakat, an essential pillar of Islamic faith, to bring positive change to the lives of individuals and society as a whole.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Our platform serves as a unified hub for local Masajid (mosques) to upload their information, enabling us to effectively assess eligibility and allocate Zakat funds to deserving recipients. We have created a streamlined process that ensures transparency, efficiency, and impactful distribution of Zakat contributions.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    With a deep commitment to social welfare and upliftment, Zakat Network strives to make a meaningful difference by connecting those who have Zakat funds to share with those who require support. By leveraging technology and a user-friendly interface, we have simplified the process of Zakat distribution, making it accessible to Masajid and individuals alike.

  <br />
  <p>
    Our mission goes beyond mere financial assistance. We firmly believe in fostering empowerment and sustainable change within communities. By providing a platform for Masajid to upload their information, we strengthen the network of support and enable local institutions to play an active role in addressing the needs of their congregants.
